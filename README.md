# SKYBLOCK.SK
Run Minecraft SkyBlock with Skript

SKYBLOCK.SK adds a extensive and highly customizable SkyBlock Gamemode into your server using Skript with only a small amount of dependencies. Feel free to use SKYBLOCK.SK on your server and change it as you like, enhancements can be introduced by a pull request.
	

### Dependencies
- [Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT) Minecraft Java version 1.13.2

- [skript-mirror](https://github.com/btk5h/skript-mirror)
- [TuSKe](https://github.com/Tuke-Nuke/TuSKe)

### Why SKYBLOCK.SK
SKYBLOCK.SK allows server operators to open the files plain in any editor of their choice, like Notepad++ and saving it directly into the server folder. Then reload the server and it can be used.
Thanks to the simplicity of Skript, server operators can use pseudocode like code, which is very easy to read and to change without getting in contact with Java. Skript is [well documented](http://skriptlang.github.io/Skript/), free and accessible to everyone who can read and write.
