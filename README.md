### Why SKYBLOCK.SK
SKYBLOCK.SK allows server operators to open the files plain in any editor of their choice, like Notepad++ and saving it directly into the server folder. Then reload the server and it can be used.
Thanks to the simplicity of Skript, server operators can use pseudocode like code, which is very easy to read and to change without getting in contact with Java. Skript is [well documented](http://skriptlang.github.io/Skript/), free and accessible to everyone who can read and write.
