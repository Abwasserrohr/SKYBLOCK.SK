# elevator.sk v0.0.1
# ==============
# Let users build elevators using signs
# ==============
# Dependencies
# ==============
# > Spigot 1.13.2 - https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/
# > Skript by bensku - https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases
# ==============
# How to use it:
# ==============
# > This skript doesn't need any setup on server side.
# > Steps for users:
# > 1: Place a sign on the bottom with the following contents:
# > =Line 1: [Lift]
# > =Line 2: Up
# > =Line 3: Custom
# > =Line 4: Custom
# > 2: Place a sign on the top with the following contents:
# > =Line 1: [Lift]
# > =Line 2: Down
# > =Line 3: Custom
# > =Line 4: Custom
# > Custom can replaced by players like they want to help orientation.
# > The lift signs have to be on the same x and y axis to work.
# ==============
#
# > The following options change the look of the skript
#
options:
	#
	# > Defines how the "Down" sign should look like:
	#
	sign_down: "↓ DOWN ↓"
	#
	# > Defines how the "Up" sign should look like:
	#
	sign_up: "↑ UP ↑"
	#
	# > Defines how the 1st line of the elevator sign should look like:
	#
	sign_lift: "&l[LIFT]"

#
# > Event - on rightclick on a sign
# > Actions:
# > This event gets triggered if someone rightclicks on a sign, then it is checked if
# > the clicked block (event-block) is a elevator by checking the {@sign_lift} option.
# > If it is a elevator, check if its going up or down and then go trough all blocks,
# > below the sign or above, depending if it is going up or down.
# > Then change the y-coordinate of the player to the difference between the two signs.
#
on rightclick on sign:
	if line 1 of event-block is {@sign_lift}:
		set {_loc::1} to location of event-block
		set {_loc::2} to {_loc::1}
		if line 2 of event-block is {@sign_down}:
			set y-coordinate of {_loc::1} to 0
			remove 1 from y-coordinate of {_loc::2}
		else if line 2 of event-block is {@sign_up}:
			set y-coordinate of {_loc::1} to 256
			add 1 to y-coordinate of {_loc::2}
		else:
			stop
		loop blocks within {_loc::1} to {_loc::2}:
			if loop-block is sign:
				if line 1 of loop-block is {@sign_lift}:
					set {_ploc} to location of player
					if line 2 of event-block is {@sign_down}:
						set {_diff} to difference between y-coordinate of event-block and y-coordinate of loop-block
						remove {_diff} from y-coordinate of {_ploc}
					else if line 2 of event-block is {@sign_up}:
						set {_diff} to difference between y-coordinate of event-block and y-coordinate of loop-block
						add {_diff} to y-coordinate of {_ploc}
					teleport player to {_ploc}

#
# > Event - on sign change
# > Actions:
# > Once a sign is changed, this trigger is going to check if the first line of the
# > changed sign has "[Lift]" as first line and "Up" or "Down" on the second line, if so,
# > it is going to format the sign into the right format like defined in the options. 
#
on sign change:
	if line 1 of event-block is "[Lift]":
		if line 2 of event-block is "Up" or "Down":
			set line 1 of event-block to {@sign_lift}
			if line 2 of event-block is "Down":
				set line 2 of event-block to {@sign_down}
			if line 2 of event-block is "Up":
				set line 2 of event-block to {@sign_up}
